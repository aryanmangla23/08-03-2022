Finished 25-21. Cried more times b/c of this show than from life. Learned a lot from this show. This show's relation to my experience. Relationships requires transparency. Empathy. Showed the real life of how your priorities change as you grow older. They don't change their life or career for blind love. They both could not sacrifice their career dreams to be togther. ** Another big moment was when Na Hee-Do second break up at the tunnel with Back Yi-Jin, she tries to make him understand the red flags of their slow tear down relationship started when he started to not share his struggles with her, while she always did. This broke each other's trust even though Back Yi-Jin was only doing it to protect his love and not influence her enough so her professional fencing doesn't detoriate. ALWAYS BE TRANSPARENT. A RELATIONSHIP REQUIRES THE 2 PEOPLE'S EFFORT, NOT 1 PERSON DOING ALL THE WORK**  

Last thing, ** Learn to be able to let go. **

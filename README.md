Finished 25-21. Cried more times b/c of this show than from life. Learned a lot from this show. This show's relation to my experience. Relationships requires transparency. Empathy. Showed the real life of how your priorities change as you grow older. They don't change their life or career for blind love. They both could not sacrifice their career dreams to be togther. **Another big moment was when Na Hee-Do second break up at the tunnel with Back Yi-Jin, she tries to make him understand the red flags of their slow tear down relationship started when he started to not share his struggles with her, while she always did. This broke each other's trust even though Back Yi-Jin was only doing it to protect his love and not influence her enough so her professional fencing doesn't detoriate. ALWAYS BE TRANSPARENT. A RELATIONSHIP REQUIRES THE 2 PEOPLE'S EFFORT, NOT 1 PERSON DOING ALL THE WORK**  

Last thing, **Learn to be able to let go.**

Today is an entire slack day and I'm fine with it. I will spend the next 4 days working for most the time. 

Life has its ups and downs. When I want to enjoy the ups in life with my eyes closed just taking it in by appreciating every nook and cranny and the downs in my social relationship, thinking, and life. 

Love: everything will fall into place. Don't **DONT FEAR**

**"Overcoming Fear": You cannot overcome an intangible thing. Imagine your daily life, which most people reading my diary rn are living with no fear by just being themselves. However fear is a feeling that is created by YOURSELF overthinking, excessive imagination, etc.. So the question is how do you channel or live with the fear you have created in decisions that will come with fear.**  

**For example, the fear of me telling my true feeings in this very own diary that I am making public, despite people's ability to access this. This fear is that my readers will read this, see their name, and me being honest about them in a negative manner. Again HONESTY BUILDS TRUST which builds relationships (friendship and lovers). But this specific fear will eventually come true. However, some fears may not. But for this specific one, it is about time some of my friends read it and confront me. And confrontations will create problems, and the solving of these problems if worked out properly will reinforce my relationship or if is not accepted, will remove toxic friends that will not appreciate me for who I am.** 

**Confrontation with myself: I coped for so long. and I finally know why. It was part because I loved her, but the other major part is that I couldn't be real with myself that I was majorly crying over something I gave my best effort too. To realize all my effort and feelings are alas in vain, is what in reality makes heartbreaks the hardest part. just not wanting to believe that after your effort, it didnt work. Life is about not knowing things and doing it anyways despite the consequences. And that is exactly what I am doing. I say, If you don't laugh about tragedy, you will cry about it"**
